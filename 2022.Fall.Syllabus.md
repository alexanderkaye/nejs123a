# ideas from Guiliano #

get them to play with census data from waltham. find it, parse it, add geolocation, decide what questions to ask, look for biases in the data and in their questions, ask what is missing and they wish was available, think about how to preesnt it, could they scale this up for a wider area, could they combine with other kinds of info eg weather, housing costs, food availability, mapping where people work, city infrastructure, transport routes, outside knowledge about migrations, racial makeup of hte city; think about  copyright issues, who will host it

Course Information
==================

## Course Description ##

This course will teach students to use digital tools such as graphs, maps, timelines, and text analysis to enhance their scholarship in the humanities. Students will use data drawn from their own areas of interest so this course will support any program of study in the university.

In addition to learning how to use these digital tools, students will also learn how to think *about* digital visualization: What insights can be gleaned from a timeline or a map that cannot be gleaned from a simple paragraph of text? How does digital visualization help us to make connections that we might otherwise miss? What opportunities does digital visualization offer for increasing accessibility for people with disabilities or people from disadvantaged groups? Finally, students will learn how to analyze and critique representations of data from a variety of sources, to learn from the best practices of other scholars and to be able to identify shortcomings such as implicit bias in the selection of sources and the representation of data.

Every student will produce their own work of digital visualization based on their own research interests. (This might be, for example, a graphic timeline of the life of Muhammad, a network map of letters between Jewish women in the 19th century, an interactive annotation of a Hebrew poem, a word cloud analysis of the Fiqh,and so on.) The best projects will be featured on the department's website and will be a showcase of the talents of Brandeis students.

The skills taught in this course are highly prized in the job market and are applicable to a wide variety of professions as well as further study in graduate school and beyond.

## Learning Goals ##

This course is intended to fulfill requirements in the Foundational Literacies of Digital Literacy and Oral Communication.

After this course, students will:

1.  Learn practical skills in the digital visualization of data in various fields in the humanities, using tools such as timelines and maps, and acquiring the ability to create websites.
2.  Appreciate the potential of the digital humanities for enhancing research and the opportunities it provides for increasing accessibility to scholarship.
3.  Learn how to analyze the digital humanities, and to critique its engagement with issues of accessibility, gender, and race.

Credit Hours
------------

Success in this 4 credit course is based on the expectation that students will spend a minimum of 9 hours of study time per week in preparation for class (readings, papers, discussion sections, preparation for exams, etc.)

# Course Requirements #

## Academic Integrity ##

Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the
highest standards of academic integrity. A student shall not submit work
that is falsified or is not the result of the student\'s own effort.
Infringement of academic honesty by a student subjects that student to
serious penalties, which may include failure on the assignment, failure
in the course, suspension from the University or other sanctions (see
section 20 of R&R). Please consult Brandeis University Rights and
Responsibilities for all policies and procedures related to academic
integrity. Students may be required to submit work to TurnItIn.com
software to verify originality. A student who is in doubt regarding
standards of academic honesty as they apply to a specific course or
assignment should consult the faculty member responsible for that course
or assignment before submitting the work. Allegations of alleged
academic dishonesty will be forwarded to the Department of Student
Rights and Community Standards. Citation and research assistance can be
found at [Brandeis Library Guides - Citing
Sources](https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723)
(<https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723>).

## Class Conduct ##

Study in the humanities entails grappling with big ideas about human thought, belief, behavior, and practice. Therefore, any course in history is bound to be the site of different opinions. Collegial debate is welcome, but aggressive behavior has no place in our classroom. Please exercise respect for your colleagues.

## Assignments and Class Attendance ##

Class attendance is required. Two unexcused  absences will be overlooked without penalty. More than two unexcused absences might result in a grade penalty.

Students are expected to  listen actively and attentively, and to respond thoughtfully and constructively during class discussions, when appropriate. 

All readings and assignments must be completed *before* the session for which they were assigned. **If an assignment is listed in the syllabus under a particular date, it must be submitted by midnight of the previous day.**

Unless excused, late assignments will not be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Extensions will not be granted except in the case of an emergency situation. **If you feel you are falling behind for any reason, please do not hesitate to reach out to the instructor.** 

The course will be managed through Google Classrooms.

## Evaluation ##

Requirements for the course include:

|                                                  |     |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:----|
| Attendance, Preparation and Active Participation | 15% |
| Exercises and assignments                        | 35% |
| Final project                                    | 50% |

There will be no mid-term or final examination.

## Essential Resources ##

### Accommodations ###

Brandeis seeks to welcome and include all
students. If you are a student who needs accommodations as outlined in
an accommodations letter, I want to support you. In order to provide
test accommodations, I need the letter more than 48 hours in advance. I
want to provide your accommodations, but cannot do so retroactively. If
you have questions about documenting a disability of requesting
accommodations, please contact [Student Accessibility
Support](https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/) (SAS
<https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/>) at 781.736.3470 or
<access@brandeis.edu>.

### Course Materials ###

All course readings will be provided by the instructor, or may be found online. As much as possible, course materials will be open access, or available for free to students through the university library. 

If you are having difficulty purchasing
course materials, please make an appointment with your Student Financial
Services or Academic Services advisor to discuss possible funding
options and/or textbook alternatives.

### Apps and equipment ###

[LATTE](file:///C:\Users\mary-annwinkelmes\Desktop\MAW%20files\Brandeis\Accessibility\LATTE)
is the Brandeis learning management system: <http://latte.brandeis.edu>.
Login using your UNET ID and password.

This course will be hosted on its own Google Classroom site. You will be given instructions about how to sign up for the class's site.

In this course, we will be exploring various technologies used in the digital humanities. All software we will use will be available for free to students. Students should have access to a computer (or other device) which has the ability to record video and audio. 

### Library

[The Brandeis Library](https://www.brandeis.edu/library/about/index.html) collections
and staff offer resources and services to support Brandeis students,
faculty and staff. These include workshops, consultations,
collaboration, materials and instruction on emerging trends in
technologies such as machine learning, emerging trends in research such
as data visualization, and emerging trends in scholarship such as open
access. Librarians at the Circulation Desk, Research Help Desk, Archives
& Special Collections, Sound & Image Media Studios, MakerLab,
AutomationLab, and Digital Scholarship Lab are available to help you.
<https://www.brandeis.edu/library/about/index.html>

### Student Support

Brandeis University is committed to
supporting all our students so they can thrive. The following resources
are available to help with the many academic and non-academic factors
that contribute to student success (finances, health, food supply,
housing, mental health counseling, academic advising, physical and
social activities, etc.). Please explore the many links on this [Support
at
Brandeis](https://www.brandeis.edu/support/undergraduate-students/browse.html)
page
(<https://www.brandeis.edu/support/undergraduate-students/browse.html>)
to find out more about the resources that Brandeis provides to help you
and your classmates to achieve success.

### Teaching Continuity

Email is the best way that I have to communicate with you outside of class. Even if email is not your usual mode of communication, please make sure that you check it every day in case the instructor needs to get in touch with you. Similarly, please make check Latte frequently so that you are aware of announcements about the course.

This course will be taught entirely online but it would in any case be wise to keep yourselves informed of possible changes and disruptions that might arise as a result of COVID-19. See  [Teaching
Continuity](https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html)
at <https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html>).

Technology policy
-----------------

The evidence increasingly suggests that most students produce better work and receive higher grades when taking notes by hand rather than using a laptop. For this  reason, even though you will be sitting in front of a computer for your virtual meetings, I recommend that you consider taking notes by hand. 

During our virtual meetings, please resist the urge to check email or social media, or engage in other behaviour that will distract you from class. The urge to loose focus is very strong but please do everything you can to make sure you are focussed on class during the time that we meet.

# Assignments #

::: notes
## Assignment 0 (ongoing) ##

Choose any digital humanities project. You can find one from the list
included in the "Resources" section of the syllabus, or by looking
through the databases listed there, or just find one one your
own. Answer the following questions. Your answers to these questions
should become more sophisticated as the course unfolds.

* Title and URL of the project
* How does the project describe itself and its goals? (If it does not
offer a description, desribe it in your own words.)
* Where does the project succeed in its goals and where does it fail?
* What choices did the authors of the project make in terms of what
data to display, how to display it, how to interpret it, etc? What
are the costs and benefits of these choices?
* Assess the project in terms of the various topics we will be
discussing in class (eg. gender and racial equity; accessibliity;
added-value of digital tools etc.)
:::

## Assignment 1: Preliminary Thoughts ##

Visit <https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/>[What is Digital Humanities?]  and refresh the page several times. 

* Offer your own definition of "digital humanities".
* How do you think the digital humanities might be helpful in terms of adding to our knowledge, understanding, and enhancing social values (justice, equality, freedom...)?
* How do you think the digitla humanities might impede adding to our knowledge, understanding, and enhancing social values (justice, equality, freedom...)?
* How has digital technology affected online learning today? How has COVID-19 altered the way we think about online learning? How have technological advances in general (eg access to copmuters; the way we use smartphones today etc.) changed the way we learn? You might want to skim through some of the relevant articles at [The Chronical of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/package/online-learning).

## Assignment 2: Beginning preparation for the final project ##

This assignment is designed to get you to start thinking about your final projects. Even though the project will not be due until the end of the semester, some aspects of your research, especially choosing an appropriate topic and gathering useable data, may take soem time. So it is important that we get started early in the semester. 

The answers to this assignment will be given to Alex Willett, one of the librarians who specialize in DH, so that they can begin thinking about how to help you in your research. Treat this as an opportunity to begin a conversation with someone who will be an important resource for you as you pursue your research. 

* Prepare two or three ideas that you are considering for your final projects. For each idea, answer the following questions: 
    * What questions are you interested in answering?
    * What do you think DH tools will contribute to your research? What are you hoping to achieve in either the research or the presentation of your findings that DH will be useful for? 
    * What are you concerned or unsure about?
    * What kind of DH tools would you like to use (eg. mapping, timelines, podcasting, videos, text processing...)
    * What kind of data will you need for your project? Where will you look for it? What help do you need in trying to find it?

## Assignment 3: Experimenting with data visualization ##

* Experiment with data visualization. Pick any topic (the history of the violin; the eating habits of your rabbit; religious life in Macau...) and experiment with representing information about that topic visually. You might choose to use a timeline, graphs, or any other graphical representation. Experiment - this should be fun.
* Some tools you might consider using include: 
    * 
* Write about 500 words about your experience. What did it feel like to present information in this way? How did it compare to writing an essay about the same topic? What was gained and what was lost in presenting information in this way?

## Assignment 4: Voyant ##

* Pick any readings from the course so far (or any other reading on the topic, if you prefer.) You should use texts that add up to at least 5000 words.
* Before using Voyant, write about 100 words (note form is OK) about what you think the computer analysis will reveal about the readings.
* Then enter the texts into Voyant and experiment with its different tools. 
* Write about 500 words about what you learnt from the computational analysis using Voyant. Were your earlier expectations confirmed or challenged? How did Voyant help you in your understanding or analysis of the texts?

## Assignment 5: Gender, Race and Accessibility ##

Choose any digital humanities project. You can find one from the list included in the "Resources" section of the syllabus, or by looking
through the databases listed there, or just find one one your
own. Create a video 5-7 minutes in length, in which you address the questions below. You might like to accompany your video with slides using Zoom "screenshare" or Echo360. 

* How does the project describe itself and its goals? (If it does not
  offer a description, desribe it in your own words.)
* Where does the project succeed in its goals and where does it fail? 
* What does  the use of technology add to the project? Is it integral to the project or more superficial? What are the  costs and benefits of the use of technology in this case?
