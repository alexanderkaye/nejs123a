<h2 id="contact-details">Contact Details</h2>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Alexander Kaye (NEJS)</p>
<p>Office location: The Mandel Center for the Humanities rm. 307</p>
<p>Email: <a
href="mailto:alexanderkaye@brandeis.edu">alexanderkaye@brandeis.edu</a></p>
<p>Email is the best way to contact me. I will endeavour to respond
within 24 hours (excepting weekends and university or religious
holidays).</p>
<p>Office hours will be held online on Thursday 12-1 pm., or at other
times by appointment, either virtually or in-person. <em>Please sign up
for a slot in office hours in advance.</em></p>
<h1 id="course-information">Course Information</h1>
<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>This course will teach students to use digital tools such as graphs,
maps, timelines, and text analysis to enhance their scholarship in the
humanities. Students will use data drawn from their own areas of
interest so this course will support any program of study in the
university.</p>
<p>In addition to learning how to use these digital tools, students will
also learn how to think <em>about</em> digital visualization: What
insights can be gleaned from a timeline or a map that cannot be gleaned
from a simple paragraph of text? How does digital visualization help us
to make connections that we might otherwise miss? What opportunities
does digital visualization offer for increasing accessibility for people
with disabilities or people from disadvantaged groups? Finally, students
will learn how to analyze and critique representations of data from a
variety of sources, to learn from the best practices of other scholars
and to be able to identify shortcomings such as implicit bias in the
selection of sources and the representation of data.</p>
<p>Every student will produce their own work of digital visualization
based on their own research interests. (This might be, for example, a
graphic timeline of the life of Muhammad, a network map of letters
between Jewish women in the 19th century, an interactive annotation of a
Hebrew poem, a word cloud analysis of the Fiqh,and so on.) The best
projects will be featured on the department’s website and will be a
showcase of the talents of Brandeis students.</p>
<p>The skills taught in this course are highly prized in the job market
and are applicable to a wide variety of professions as well as further
study in graduate school and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
<p>This course is intended to fulfill requirements in the Foundational
Literacies of Digital Literacy and Oral Communication.</p>
<p>After this course, students will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Learn practical skills in the digital visualization of data in
various fields in the humanities, using tools such as timelines and
maps, and acquiring the ability to create websites.</li>
<li>Appreciate the potential of the digital humanities for enhancing
research and the opportunities it provides for increasing accessibility
to scholarship.</li>
<li>Learn how to analyze the digital humanities, and to critique its
engagement with issues of accessibility, gender, and race.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="credit-hours">Credit Hours</h2>
<p>Success in this 4 credit course is based on the expectation that
students will spend a minimum of 9 hours of study time per week in
preparation for class (readings, papers, discussion sections,
preparation for exams, etc.)</p>
<h1 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the
highest standards of academic integrity. A student shall not submit work
that is falsified or is not the result of the student's own effort.
Infringement of academic honesty by a student subjects that student to
serious penalties, which may include failure on the assignment, failure
in the course, suspension from the University or other sanctions (see
section 20 of R&amp;R). Please consult Brandeis University Rights and
Responsibilities for all policies and procedures related to academic
integrity. Students may be required to submit work to TurnItIn.com
software to verify originality. A student who is in doubt regarding
standards of academic honesty as they apply to a specific course or
assignment should consult the faculty member responsible for that course
or assignment before submitting the work. Allegations of alleged
academic dishonesty will be forwarded to the Department of Student
Rights and Community Standards. Citation and research assistance can be
found at <a
href="https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723">Brandeis
Library Guides - Citing Sources</a> (<a

class="uri">https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723</a>).</p>
<h2 id="class-conduct">Class Conduct</h2>
<p>Study in the humanities entails grappling with big ideas about human
thought, belief, behavior, and practice. Therefore, any course in
history is bound to be the site of different opinions. Collegial debate
is welcome, but aggressive behavior has no place in our classroom.
Please exercise respect for your colleagues.</p>
<h2 id="assignments-and-class-attendance">Assignments and Class
Attendance</h2>
<p>Class attendance is required. Two unexcused absences will be
overlooked without penalty. More than two unexcused absences might
result in a grade penalty.</p>
<p>Students are expected to listen actively and attentively, and to
respond thoughtfully and constructively during class discussions, when
appropriate.</p>
<p>All readings and assignments must be completed <em>before</em> the
session for which they were assigned. <strong>If an assignment is listed
in the syllabus under a particular date, it must be submitted by
midnight of the previous day.</strong></p>
<p>Unless excused, late assignments will not be accepted and will
receive a grade of zero. Extensions will not be granted except in the
case of an emergency situation. <strong>If you feel you are falling
behind for any reason, please do not hesitate to reach out to the
instructor.</strong></p>
<p>The course will be managed through Google Classrooms.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Requirements for the course include:</p>

<h3 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h3>
<p>Brandeis seeks to welcome and include all students. If you are a
student who needs accommodations as outlined in an accommodations
letter, I want to support you. In order to provide test accommodations,
I need the letter more than 48 hours in advance. I want to provide your
accommodations, but cannot do so retroactively. If you have questions
about documenting a disability of requesting accommodations, please
contact <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/">Student
Accessibility Support</a> (SAS <a

<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>
<p>All course readings will be provided by the instructor, or may be
found online. As much as possible, course materials will be open access,
or available for free to students through the university library.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulty purchasing course materials, please make
an appointment with your Student Financial Services or Academic Services
advisor to discuss possible funding options and/or textbook
alternatives.</p>

which has the ability to record video and audio.</p>
<h3 id="library">Library</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/library/about/index.html">The
Brandeis Library</a> collections and staff offer resources and services
to support Brandeis students, faculty and staff. These include
workshops, consultations, collaboration, materials and instruction on
emerging trends in technologies such as machine learning, emerging
trends in research such as data visualization, and emerging trends in

<h3 id="student-support">Student Support</h3>
<p>Brandeis University is committed to supporting all our students so
they can thrive. The following resources are available to help with the
many academic and non-academic factors that contribute to student
success (finances, health, food supply, housing, mental health
counseling, academic advising, physical and social activities, etc.).
Please explore the many links on this <a

<h3 id="teaching-continuity">Teaching Continuity</h3>
<p>Email is the best way that I have to communicate with you outside of
class. Even if email is not your usual mode of communication, please
make sure that you check it every day in case the instructor needs to
get in touch with you. Similarly, please make check Latte frequently so
that you are aware of announcements about the course.</p>
<p>This course will be taught entirely online but it would in any case
be wise to keep yourselves informed of possible changes and disruptions
that might arise as a result of COVID-19. See <a
href="https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html">Teaching
Continuity</a> at <a

class="uri">https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html</a>).</p>
<h2 id="technology-policy">Technology policy</h2>
<p>The evidence increasingly suggests that most students produce better
work and receive higher grades when taking notes by hand rather than
using a laptop. For this reason, even though you will be sitting in
front of a computer for your virtual meetings, I recommend that you
consider taking notes by hand.</p>
<p>During our virtual meetings, please resist the urge to check email or
social media, or engage in other behaviour that will distract you from
class. The urge to loose focus is very strong but please do everything
you can to make sure you are focussed on class during the time that we
meet.</p>
<h1 id="course-resources">Course Resources</h1>
<p>During the course, you will spend a lot of time experimenting,
exploring, analyzing and assessing digital humanities projects on the
web. The resources below give you some places to start as you are

however. Follow your curiosity and interests to wherever you want to
go.</p>

<p>For each of the websites we have explored today, write <em>brief</em>
answers to the following questions (bullet form is fine.):</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some questions you would like to “ask” of the data?</li>
<li>What is missing in the data that you wish was there?</li>
<li>Are there other bodies of data that you think it would be helpful to
combine with the data already provided? Where would you look to find
that new data?</li>
<li>Are any biases present in the data? Are any biases present in the
questions you are asking about it?</li>
<li>Start brainstorming about other bodies of data that you might be
interested in exploring.</li>
