# NEJS 123a - Maps, Graphs and Timelines: Technology and Design in Historical Research

## Contact Details

**Instructor:** Alexander Kaye (NEJS)

Office location: The Mandel Center for the Humanities rm. 307

Email: <alexanderkaye@brandeis.edu>

Email is the best way to contact me. I will endeavour to respond within
24 hours (excepting weekends and university or religious holidays).

## Meeting Times

### Office hours

Office hours will be held online on Thursday 12-1 pm., or at other times
by appointment, either virtually or in-person. *Please sign up for a
slot in office hours in advance.*

# Course Information

## Course Description

This course will teach students to use digital tools such as graphs,
maps, timelines, and text analysis to enhance their scholarship in the
humanities. Students will use data drawn from their own areas of
interest so this course will support any program of study in the
university.

In addition to learning how to use these digital tools, students will
also learn how to think *about* digital visualization: What insights can
be gleaned from a timeline or a map that cannot be gleaned from a simple
paragraph of text? How does digital visualization help us to make
connections that we might otherwise miss? What opportunities does
digital visualization offer for increasing accessibility for people with
disabilities or people from disadvantaged groups? Finally, students will
learn how to analyze and critique representations of data from a variety
of sources, to learn from the best practices of other scholars and to be
able to identify shortcomings such as implicit bias in the selection of
sources and the representation of data.

Every student will produce their own work of digital visualization based
on their own research interests. (This might be, for example, a graphic
timeline of the life of Muhammad, a network map of letters between
Jewish women in the 19th century, an interactive annotation of a Hebrew
poem, a word cloud analysis of the Fiqh,and so on.) The best projects
will be featured on the department’s website and will be a showcase of
the talents of Brandeis students.

The skills taught in this course are highly prized in the job market and
are applicable to a wide variety of professions as well as further study
in graduate school and beyond.

## Learning Goals

This course is intended to fulfill requirements in the Foundational
Literacies of Digital Literacy and Oral Communication.

After this course, students will:

1.  Learn practical skills in the digital visualization of data in
    various fields in the humanities, using tools such as timelines and
    maps, and acquiring the ability to create websites.
2.  Appreciate the potential of the digital humanities for enhancing
    research and the opportunities it provides for increasing
    accessibility to scholarship.
3.  Learn how to analyze the digital humanities, and to critique its
    engagement with issues of accessibility, gender, and race.

## Credit Hours

Success in this 4 credit course is based on the expectation that
students will spend a minimum of 9 hours of study time per week in
preparation for class (readings, papers, discussion sections,
preparation for exams, etc.)

# Course Requirements

## Academic Integrity

Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the
highest standards of academic integrity. A student shall not submit work
that is falsified or is not the result of the student's own effort.
Infringement of academic honesty by a student subjects that student to
serious penalties, which may include failure on the assignment, failure
in the course, suspension from the University or other sanctions (see
section 20 of R&R). Please consult Brandeis University Rights and
Responsibilities for all policies and procedures related to academic
integrity. Students may be required to submit work to TurnItIn.com
software to verify originality. A student who is in doubt regarding
standards of academic honesty as they apply to a specific course or
assignment should consult the faculty member responsible for that course
or assignment before submitting the work. Allegations of alleged
academic dishonesty will be forwarded to the Department of Student
Rights and Community Standards. Citation and research assistance can be
found at [Brandeis Library Guides - Citing
Sources](https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723)
(<https://guides.library.brandeis.edu/c.php?g=301723>).

## Class Conduct

Study in the humanities entails grappling with big ideas about human
thought, belief, behavior, and practice. Therefore, any course in
history is bound to be the site of different opinions. Collegial debate
is welcome, but aggressive behavior has no place in our classroom.
Please exercise respect for your colleagues.

## Assignments and Class Attendance

Class attendance is required. Two unexcused absences will be overlooked
without penalty. More than two unexcused absences might result in a
grade penalty.

Students are expected to listen actively and attentively, and to respond
thoughtfully and constructively during class discussions, when
appropriate.

All readings and assignments must be completed *before* the session for
which they were assigned. **If an assignment is listed in the syllabus
under a particular date, it must be submitted by midnight of the
previous day.**

Unless excused, late assignments will not be accepted and will receive a
grade of zero. Extensions will not be granted except in the case of an
emergency situation. **If you feel you are falling behind for any
reason, please do not hesitate to reach out to the instructor.**

Assignments should be submitted to LATTE.

## Evaluation

Requirements for the course include:

|                                                  |     |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:----|
| Attendance, Preparation and Active Participation | 15% |
| Exercises and assignments                        | 35% |
| Final project                                    | 50% |

There will be no mid-term or final examination.

## Essential Resources

### Accommodations

Brandeis seeks to welcome and include all students. If you are a student
who needs accommodations as outlined in an accommodations letter, I want
to support you. In order to provide test accommodations, I need the
letter more than 48 hours in advance. I want to provide your
accommodations, but cannot do so retroactively. If you have questions
about documenting a disability of requesting accommodations, please
contact [Student Accessibility
Support](https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/) (SAS
<https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/>) at 781.736.3470 or
<access@brandeis.edu>.

### Course Materials

All course readings will be provided by the instructor, or may be found
online. As much as possible, course materials will be open access, or
available for free to students through the university library.

If you are having difficulty purchasing course materials, please make an
appointment with your Student Financial Services or Academic Services
advisor to discuss possible funding options and/or textbook
alternatives.

### Apps and equipment

[LATTE](file:///C:\Users\mary-annwinkelmes\Desktop\MAW%20files\Brandeis\Accessibility\LATTE)
is the Brandeis learning management system: <http://latte.brandeis.edu>.
Login using your UNET ID and password.

This course will be hosted on its own Google Classroom site. You will be
given instructions about how to sign up for the class’s site.

In this course, we will be exploring various technologies used in the
digital humanities. All software we will use will be available for free
to students. Students should have access to a computer (or other device)
which has the ability to record video and audio.

### Library

[The Brandeis
Library](https://www.brandeis.edu/library/about/index.html) collections
and staff offer resources and services to support Brandeis students,
faculty and staff. These include workshops, consultations,
collaboration, materials and instruction on emerging trends in
technologies such as machine learning, emerging trends in research such
as data visualization, and emerging trends in scholarship such as open
access. Librarians at the Circulation Desk, Research Help Desk, Archives
& Special Collections, Sound & Image Media Studios, MakerLab,
AutomationLab, and Digital Scholarship Lab are available to help you.
<https://www.brandeis.edu/library/about/index.html>

### Student Support

Brandeis University is committed to supporting all our students so they
can thrive. The following resources are available to help with the many
academic and non-academic factors that contribute to student success
(finances, health, food supply, housing, mental health counseling,
academic advising, physical and social activities, etc.). Please explore
the many links on this [Support at
Brandeis](https://www.brandeis.edu/support/undergraduate-students/browse.html)
page
(<https://www.brandeis.edu/support/undergraduate-students/browse.html>)
to find out more about the resources that Brandeis provides to help you
and your classmates to achieve success.

### Teaching Continuity

Email is the best way that I have to communicate with you outside of
class. Even if email is not your usual mode of communication, please
make sure that you check it every day in case the instructor needs to
get in touch with you. Similarly, please make check Latte frequently so
that you are aware of announcements about the course.

This course will be taught entirely online but it would in any case be
wise to keep yourselves informed of possible changes and disruptions
that might arise as a result of COVID-19. See [Teaching
Continuity](https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html)
at <https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html>).

## Technology policy

The evidence increasingly suggests that most students produce better
work and receive higher grades when taking notes by hand rather than
using a laptop. For this reason, even though you will be sitting in
front of a computer for your virtual meetings, I recommend that you
consider taking notes by hand.

During our virtual meetings, please resist the urge to check email or
social media, or engage in other behaviour that will distract you from
class. The urge to loose focus is very strong but please do everything
you can to make sure you are focussed on class during the time that we
meet.

# Course Resources

During the course, you will spend a lot of time experimenting,
exploring, analyzing and assessing digital humanities projects on the
web. The resources below give you some places to start as you are

# Assignments

## Assignment 1: Preliminary Thoughts

Visit <https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/>\[What is Digital
Humanities?\] and refresh the page several times.

- Offer your own definition of “digital humanities”.
- How do you think the digital humanities might be helpful in terms of
  adding to our knowledge, understanding, and enhancing social values
  (justice, equality, freedom…)?
- How do you think the digitla humanities might impede adding to our
  knowledge, understanding, and enhancing social values (justice,
  equality, freedom…)?
- How has digital technology affected online learning today? How has
  COVID-19 altered the way we think about online learning? How have
  technological advances in general (eg access to copmuters; the way we
  use smartphones today etc.) changed the way we learn? You might want
  to skim through some of the relevant articles at [The Chronical of
  Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/package/online-learning).

## Assignment 2: Beginning preparation for the final project

This assignment is designed to get you to start thinking about your
final projects. Even though the project will not be due until the end of
the semester, some aspects of your research, especially choosing an
appropriate topic and gathering useable data, may take soem time. So it
is important that we get started early in the semester.

The answers to this assignment will be given to Alex Willett, one of the
librarians who specialize in DH, so that they can begin thinking about
how to help you in your research. Treat this as an opportunity to begin
a conversation with someone who will be an important resource for you as
you pursue your research.

- Prepare two or three ideas that you are considering for your final
  projects. For each idea, answer the following questions:
  - What questions are you interested in answering?
  - What do you think DH tools will contribute to your research? What
    are you hoping to achieve in either the research or the presentation
    of your findings that DH will be useful for?
  - What are you concerned or unsure about?
  - What kind of DH tools would you like to use (eg. mapping, timelines,
    podcasting, videos, text processing…)
  - What kind of data will you need for your project? Where will you
    look for it? What help do you need in trying to find it?

## Assignment 3: Experimenting with data visualization

- Experiment with data visualization. Pick any topic (the history of the
  violin; the eating habits of your rabbit; religious life in Macau…)
  and experiment with representing information about that topic
  visually. You might choose to use a timeline, graphs, or any other
  graphical representation. Experiment - this should be fun.
- Some tools you might consider using include:
  - 
- Write about 500 words about your experience. What did it feel like to
  present information in this way? How did it compare to writing an
  essay about the same topic? What was gained and what was lost in
  presenting information in this way?

## Assignment 4: Voyant

- Pick any readings from the course so far (or any other reading on the
  topic, if you prefer.) You should use texts that add up to at least
  5000 words.
- Before using Voyant, write about 100 words (note form is OK) about
  what you think the computer analysis will reveal about the readings.
- Then enter the texts into Voyant and experiment with its different
  tools.
- Write about 500 words about what you learnt from the computational
  analysis using Voyant. Were your earlier expectations confirmed or
  challenged? How did Voyant help you in your understanding or analysis
  of the texts?

## Assignment 5: Gender, Race and Accessibility

Choose any digital humanities project. You can find one from the list
included in the “Resources” section of the syllabus, or by looking
through the databases listed there, or just find one one your own.
Create a video 5-7 minutes in length, in which you address the questions
below. You might like to accompany your video with slides using Zoom
“screenshare” or Echo360.

- How does the project describe itself and its goals? (If it does not
  offer a description, desribe it in your own words.)
- Where does the project succeed in its goals and where does it fail?
- What does the use of technology add to the project? Is it integral to
  the project or more superficial? What are the costs and benefits of
  the use of technology in this case?
- What choices did the authors of the project make in terms of what data
  to display, how to display it, how to interpret it, etc? What are the
  costs and benefits of these choices?
- Assess the project in terms of its engagement (implicit or explicit)
  with issues of gender, racial equity and accessibliity.
