					Why this Project?
				</h1>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					When I began this project, I didn’t really have a vision of what it would become. At the time, I was only familiar with a few of the royal members of the House of Bernadotte, with little knowledge of the rest of the family and practically no sense of the other royal houses in the monarchy. I never anticipated that the genealogy would expand to the incredible twenty-seven hundred individuals it has at the moment. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					As the size of the genealogy grew, so did my appreciation of the connections between the dozens, if not hundreds of noble and royal families portrayed on this site. Every element of human history is portrayed through this extended family, from war to intermarriage to drama surrounding illegitimate children. It connects not only royal and noble families across the globe, but also many “normal” people, including relatives of George Washington.
				</p>
				<a id="Process" name="Process" title="The Process"></a>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					The unfortunate fact is that it is difficult, using this website alone, to get a full sense of this history. There's no end to how much information I could have added in; instead I stuck to simple biographical information (for the most part). This site represents the start of a potential longer project covering more broad trends in European monarchical history, which, however far off it may seem, does affect our lives to this day. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					Along with the historical aspects of the project, I also approached it from a personal point of view. As someone who is an advanced student of the Swedish language and has family in Sweden, I leap for every opportunity to learn more about Sweden's history and culture. The project also allowed me to practice my Swedish a little, with endless opportunities to find data on Swedish websites.

					The Process
				</h1>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					The first and most time-consuming step of creating this website was gathering information. Finding sources was extremely slow-going and quite difficult, particularly in the beginning, as data concerning the extended royal family is not particularly easy to find. For this reason, I had to rely an unfortunate amount on data from Wikipedia pages, though I was very often able to verify that data on other websites. 

				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					Additionally, most of the data concerning the earlier monarchs comes from sagas and chronicles which can often be contradictory and sometimes don’t mention certain pieces of information. In other cases, there might be different interpretations among modern scholars about who a saga is referring to, particularly in cases where there is only a little information given. For this reason, several of the early monarchs were not assigned spouses in the database, since there is a continuing debate among scholars as to who their spouses were. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					I entered my data into an open source genealogy software called Gramps. Gramps was remarkably easy to use and made the entering of data go very smoothly. In addition, it was already set up with several systems of visually exporting data, including personalized websites like the one I have created. 
				</p>
				<a id="Gramps" name="Gramps" title="Limitations of Gramps"></a>
				<h1 style= font-size:larger>
					Limitations of Gramps
				</h1>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					Though overall it was very helpful to be able to use Gramps, both for the data entry and the website generation, there were a couple of problems which forced me to spend a lot of time coding the website to get it to its current state. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					To start off with, the  website was designed with an individual page of code for every page of the site, and each page repeated the taskbar code separately. This meant that it was very time-consuming to edit the taskbar or header of the site, since I needed to make any such edit on every page of the site. With all of the individual pages, the surname pages, the family pages, the media pages, and the main pages, this added up to nearly six thousand pages. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					Another problem with the software itself showed up when I attempted to use a function that would display every individual’s relationship to the current king, Carl XVI Gustaf, on their individual pages. Due (I believe) to the sheer number of people I had entered into the database and the incredibly complicated relationships they all had with one another, the program crashed repeatedly each time I attempted it. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-right:5%">
					There were also problems when it came to displaying an individual’s information on the website. Gramps has options to include “Title” and “Call Name” for a person, “Call Name” being, basically, the name someone is called. This was extremely helpful when it came to people with more than 5 names (for example, <u><a href="ppl/5/1/e94d127d7097da6a7b4ed104415.html" title="of Anhalt, Antoinette Anna Alexandra Marie Luise Agnes Elisabeth Auguste Friederike">Antoinette Anna Alexandra Marie Luise Agnes Elisabeth Auguste Friederike of Anhalt</a></u>, whose call name was Antoinette), as many nobles or royals did (and do). The “Title” spot was used to record nobility titles like Duke or Count. However, after entering the data, when I generated my website neither “Title” nor “Call Name” showed up in the exported data on the website. I ended up having to go back through about a thousand entries and reenter the "Title" data, though I was unable to find a suitable place where I could transfer the "Call Name".
